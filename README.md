## Project Description
The project is regarding the Hangman game. The logic regarding the input was forked into four main scenarios:

1 Scenario:
- Input is right and in the word: no iteration over failed attempts

2 Scenario:
- Input is right but not in the word
- Iteration over attempts and the HANGMAN

3 Scenario:

- Input is right but letter already guessed

4 Scenario
- Input is wrong (typo etc)

Regarding the choice of the word, it was created by choosing randomly a word from a given list

The final result:

1) Win if world letters length is equal to zero

OR

2) Lost if there are no more attempts left, attempts is equal to zero

Finally, asked if player wants to play one more time

The is a cycle that keeps asking the user for input if there is no winner or loser yet.
